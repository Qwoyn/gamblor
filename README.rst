Introduction
============

Gamblor is a real-time casino app built for the 2012
`Django Dash <http://www.djangodash.com/>`_.

The idea was to provide a plugin system for games that
can be played collaboratively in real-time using WebSockets,
and to that end Gamblor was successful.

Check out the deployed version at

========

  * Simple plugin system for adding games with their own turn
    arguments, template, JavaScript and CSS files.
  * Initial games implemented are simple versions of Roulette and
    Craps.

    the game room and bash into your friends.
  * Chat system - talk to other avatars, messages are displayed
    above each avatar in real-time.
